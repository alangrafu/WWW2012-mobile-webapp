The WWW 2012 Mobile Assistant webapp provides information about WWW2012, authors, papers, a cloud of main form their subjects and where the talks will be located.
It also provides information about past conferences, previous papers by authors and organizations. The WWW2012 Mobile Assistant also help you share papers you find interesting via Facebook and Twitter.
This mobile assistant was created using two main software tools:

<h3>LODSPeaKr</h3>
LODSPeaKr is a framework for creating Linked Data-based applications. It allow developers to define queries and templates for different types of URIs (based on the <tt>rdf:type</tt> predicate).
<br/><br/>For example, when the client request a document related to a URIs whose type is <tt>foaf:Person</tt>, LODSPeaKr will execute four different queries:
<ul>
<li><strong>details.query</strong>: Will fetch first and family name of the person</li>
<li><strong>affiliation.query</strong>: Organization(s) that the person is affiliated to</li>
<li><strong>papers.query</strong>: Papers of WWW2012 that this person authored</li>
<li><strong>history.query</strong>: Number of publications in previous WWW conferences published by this person</li>
</ul>

It is also possible to create <strong>services</strong>, i.e., documents LODSPeaKr provides content negotiation via HTTP 303 redirection to deliver content. Currently LODSPeaKr supports
HTML, RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples and RDFJSON. When a browser requests a valid URI, it is redirected to a webpage that displays the information. This 
pages is generated based on the queries defined by the developers as well as the template that indicates how this information must be displayed. LODSPeaKr uses <a href='http://haanga.org'>Haanga</a> as the 
templating engine. The template consists in a HTML file where the developer can include CSS and JavaScript files as she would normally do in any web-based application. For the WWW2012 Mobile Assistant I decided to
use JQuery Mobile to develop the front-end.


<h3>JQuery Mobile</h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'>
JQuery mobile is a Javascript framework that helps developers to create smartphone-compatible applications. It provides 
multiple features, such as touch-support events and dynamic layout. JQuery mobile was used to build the HTML template for the WWW2012 Mobile Assistant by using the Javascript library as
well as the CSS style sheets.
